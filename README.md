# Twitter Image Downloader
A web application made with Node.js to automatically download images from public Twitter posts (tweets) in high resolution png files.

The app is hosted here: https://twitter-image-downloader.onrender.com/
* Simply input in the URL to a Twitter post that contains images to the text box and click the "Download" button.

I use Twitter to collect and save art from my favorite artists on Twitter. Twitter's default parameters for downloading images is usually in medium resolution jpg files so I usually have to manually change it. I made this application to make archiving art easier for me.
